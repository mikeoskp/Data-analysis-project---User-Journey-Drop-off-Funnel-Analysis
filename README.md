# User Journey & Drop-off Funnel Analysis

## 📌 Project Objective
Analyze user behavior across different stages of a digital product funnel to identify **drop-off points, friction areas, and conversion bottlenecks**.  
The goal is to improve user retention and conversion by understanding how users move through the journey.

This project simulates a real-world **product analytics / growth analytics** use case widely used by product, marketing, and data teams.

- `event_name` – Funnel stage (visit, signup, add_to_cart, checkout, purchase)
- `device` – Mobile / Desktop
- `traffic_source` – Organic, Paid, Referral
- `country` – User location
- `session_id` – User session
- `time_spent_sec` – Time spent on each step
